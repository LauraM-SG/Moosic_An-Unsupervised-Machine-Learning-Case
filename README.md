# Moosic Playlists-An nsupervised-Machine-Learning-Case

**Moosic Playlists** is an exploratory project designed to **learn and demonstrate the application of Unsupervised Machine Learning (UML)** techniques by generating   music playlists from Spotify audio data.

This repository is not a production-ready app, but rather a **learning case study** that showcases how clustering algorithms like K-Means can be used to group songs into coherent "vibe-based" playlists â€” without any labeled genres or user input.
